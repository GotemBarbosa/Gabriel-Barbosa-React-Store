# React Store


## About the project

React store is a project for  [**SCANDIWEB**](https://scandiweb.com/) Entry React developer Test, 
where a store should be developed with all given requirements, 
following code concepts and other aspects like design and showing 
knowledge of technologies like React/JS/HTML/CSS and also overcoming code issues.

The development goal was to code the given project with the best possible quality, following the design and making additions based on design details,
like the lack of items in a shopping cart (which was not given in the design) and some other cool details. It was also neccessary to fetch a Graphql 
endpoind and provide interaction with this data. About the React itself, it was necessary to do a project planning, looking for what technologies
I should use to provide what was expected of me and because of this the project is now achieving the desired requirements.


## Project Layout
* The layout was given by Scandiweb and I should implement it as closely as possible.
